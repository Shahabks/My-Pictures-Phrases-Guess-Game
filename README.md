# Speaking Guess-Game: Pictures-Phrases

Using Spoken Language to play this game - it was developed on the shoulders of CNN and RNN and it is at its Early Stage.

We designed this simple game to study prosody and pronunciation of words in English. It could be developed for other languages

Inputs could be either words, phrases or pictures.

The game was built on the foundation of an AI and machine learning structure which is being developed for an analytic speech and voice system. The system was developed upon the shoulders of an acoustic and a natural language understanding model. We are working on our CNN Machine learning algorithm to add more languages and create new functions.
