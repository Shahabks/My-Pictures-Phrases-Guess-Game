# My-Pictures-Phrases-Guess-Game
Using Spoken Language to play this game - developed on the shoulders of CNN and RNN - Early Stage

A simple game for checking prosody of speech and pronunciation ENGLISH now.

Inputs could be either words and phrases or pictures.

The game was built on the foundation of an AI and machine learning structure which is being developed for a speech and voice recognition system. The system was developed upon the shoulders of an acoustic and a natural language understanding model. We are working on our CNN Machine learning algorithm to add more languages and create new functions.

To run the program on your computer, download and save the compressed folders called 

                                                      2.7z
                                                      3.7z
                                                      4.7z
                                                      5.7z
then extract (unzip) them in a folder; called 

                                                    "mypictest" 

Before running "mypictest.exe" in the folder "mypictest" you need to add the acoustic and language models. To get the models please contact me at:

                      The acoustic and language models files are large, so I was unable to 
                      upload them in my Github. 
                      Please contact me to share the files with you 

 After downloading/extracting all the necessary installation files, please run "mypictest.exe" and follow the instruction which will pop out on the screen.
You need to save the pictures of your choice in a folder. There is a sample folder that you may use. Please feel free to download it called "test".

Please contact me if you need further information or you wish to build in specific applications to the program

                                                      Development

This package was developed by MYOLUTIONS Lab in Japan for test. It is part of New Generation of Voice Recognition and Analysis Project in MYSOLUTIONS Lab. That is planned to enrich the functionality of My-Voice Analysis by adding more advanced functions.
