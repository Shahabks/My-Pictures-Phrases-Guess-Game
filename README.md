# My-Pictures-Phrases-Guess-Game
Using Spoken Language to play this game - developed on the shoulders of CNN and RNN - Early Stage

A simple game for checking prosody of speech and pronunciation ENGLISH now.

Inputs could be either words and phrases or pictures.

The game was built on the foundation of an AI and machine learning structure which is being developed for a speech and voice recognition system. The system was developed upon the shoulders of an acoustic and a natural language understanding model. We are working on our CNN Machine learning algorithm to add more languages and create new functions.

To run the program, download and save the compressed folders called 

                                                      2.7z
                                                      3.7z
                                                      4.7z
                                                      5.7z
and unzip them in a folder; called 

                                                    "mypictest" 

on your computer, and then run "mypictest.exe". 
Please follow the instruction which will pop out when you run the program.

                      The acoustic and language models files and dataset are large, so I was unable to download in my Github. 
                      Please contact me to share the files with you 

You need to save the pictures of your choice in a folder. There is a sample folder that you may use. Please feel free to download it called "test".
